"""
Photo Drop — a single-file photo drop server for Android (Termux).

A friend opens a secret link in any phone browser, picks photos and videos,
watches them upload with real progress, and lands with a confirmation page.
The files land in DCIM on the owner's Samsung, which makes Google Photos
back them up to the owner's account automatically.

Everything the friend needs is a browser. Nothing is installed on their phone.

Design notes
------------
* MediaStore, not the filesystem, is the source of truth for Google Photos.
  Every completed file goes through media_scan.sh, which escalates through
  the known notification techniques and reports which one worked.
* Storage is checked *before* accepting a file and *during* the write, so a
  full disk degrades into a clean error instead of a half-written file.
* One file per request from the browser. That is what makes native XHR
  upload progress possible — the browser reports bytes-sent for free, which
  means no chunked protocol, no SSE, no websocket.
* Metadata lives in Termux home, never inside DCIM, so we never pollute the
  gallery with stray files.
